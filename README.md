# My Notes

In general notes for various things I'm studying, including languages, computer science, and Linux.
Thought someone might benefit from it as well so I decided to upload them on here.
Everything is in markdown so it should be readable here.
Note that none of it has been checked for spelling errors, nor has it been cleaned up. Maybe once I'm done with them I'll clean them up.
If you'd like to edit them yourself or even clean them up feel free to make a pull request.
